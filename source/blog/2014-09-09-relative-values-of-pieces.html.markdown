In xiangqi, there are often situations in which one's opponent may offer up
pieces for a trade. Without knowing the relative value of one's pieces, it can
be difficult to tell whether or not a trade is worth it. A system of relative
values of the different pieces can be useful in calculating the value of a
trade. The system presented below is only for rough estimates, and does not take
into account positional advantages gained. Sometimes it is worth it to trade
away pieces that are valuable intrinsically in order to gain a stronger
position. Note that other educational sources on xiangqi may provide slightly
different point values for the pieces, but the approximate relative values
should remain the same.

At the top of the list is the chariot, easily the most valuable piece on the
board, worth 9 points.

Next are the horse and cannons, at 4 points each. One should note that cannons
are slightly more valuable in the early game, because there are more pieces to
jump over to capture, as compared to the late game. In contrast, horses are
slightly more valuable in the late game, because there are fewer pieces to
restrict its movement.

Elephants and advisers are both worth 2 points each.

Pawns are a special case. They are worth 1 point each before they cross the
river, but are worth 2 points after they cross the river because of their
additional ability to move laterally.
