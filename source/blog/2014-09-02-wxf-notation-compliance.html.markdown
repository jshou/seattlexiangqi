It has been brought to my attention that the notation I've been using does not
match the standard notation used by the
[World Xiangqi Federation](http://www.wxf.org/xq/computer/wxf_notation.html).
Since there's a standard, I thought I'd update things to be more in line with
the WXF. Here are the changes I've made:

1. Generals are now marked with a "k" for King.
1. Horizontal movement of a piece is now marked with "." as opposed to "=".
1. Pieces that are on the same file are now identified with a "+" or "-" for
  instead of "f" or "b". Formerly, I would use "fc" to refer to the cannon
  further away from the player. WXF notation uses "c+" instead.

I've retroactively updated the [notation post](/blog/2014/05/26/xiangqi-notation.html)
to reflect these changes. Please read there for more detailed examples.

_Thanks to [Sebastian Pipping](http://blog.hartwork.org/) for bringing this to my attention!_
